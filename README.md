# My configuration for neovim

**License : GPL v3.0 or later**

## Overview

The goals for this configuration are :

* Nice syntax coloring, by tweaking the highlight settings, _while sticking to NR-8 color names_.
* Implement some key bindings that matches what I usually use on most text editors. Meaning Ctrl+S for saving, Ctrl+X/C/V for the clipboard, etc...
* Some default behavior that I see fit.

## How to use

> If you have an existing configuration, copy or move the current configuration folder
> for easier recovery.

Clone this repository as `nvim` in the folder that should contain it.

E.g. with Ubuntu, Linux :

```shell
$ cd ~/.config
$ git clone https://github.com/sporniket/my-nvim-config.git nvim
```
